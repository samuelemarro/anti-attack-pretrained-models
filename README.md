# Counter-Attack Pretrained Models
This is a mirror of [pytorch-classification](https://github.com/bearpaw/pytorch-classification)'s pretrained DenseNet-BC (L=190, k=40) models for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. They have been modified to be compatible with [counter-attack](https://github.com/samuelemarro/counter-attack). 
The ImageNet model is handled by [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision), which uses its own hosting servers.

You can download these models by running counter-attack with the flag --download-model.
